# Chinese101-Flashcards-F24

Repo containing my Anki flashcards for Chinese 101 (or ASIALANG 355) at UW-Madison. 

Download Anki at https://apps.ankiweb.net

The PC, Mac, and Android versions are free (iirc) but the official iOS app is like $25 (as that's how they pay for the app). You can still use ankiweb on iOS for free instead or an unofficial app.
